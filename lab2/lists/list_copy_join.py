'''
Copy a List
You cannot copy a list simply by typing list2 = list1, because: list2 will only be a reference to list1, and changes made in list1 will automatically also be made in list2.

There are ways to make a copy, one way is to use the built-in List method copy().'''
#Make a copy of a list with the copy() method:
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
mylist = thislist.copy()
print(mylist)

#Another way to make a copy is to use the built-in method list().
thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
mylist = list(thislist)
print(mylist)







"""
Join Two Lists
There are several ways to join, or concatenate, two or more lists in Python.

One of the easiest ways are by using the + operator."""

#Join two list:
list1 = ["a", "b", "c"]
list2 = [1, 2, 3]

list3 = list1 + list2
print(list3)


#Another way to join two lists is by appending all the items from list2 into list1, one by one:
list1 = ["a", "b" , "c"]
list2 = [1, 2, 3]

for x in list2:
  list1.append(x)

print(list1)

#Or you can use the extend() method, where the purpose is to add elements from one list to another list:
#Use the extend() method to add list2 at the end of list1:
list1 = ["a", "b" , "c"]
list2 = [1, 2, 3]

list1.extend(list2)
print(list1)
